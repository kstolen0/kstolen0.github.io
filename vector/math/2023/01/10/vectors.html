  <h1 id="vectors">Vectors</h1>

<h2 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h2>

<p>A vector is a representation of a point in space relative to another. You can think of a vector as an arrow.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_1.PNG" alt="A vector is a lot like an arrow" /></p>

<p>A vector has two properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Magnitude. This is the length of the arrow</li>
  <li>Direction. This is the angle in which the arrow is pointing.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_components.PNG" alt="A vector has a magnitude and direction" /></p>

<p>Another way we can represent a vector is via a pair of numbers, e.g. x and y.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re at point (0,0) and you move 3 units in the x direction, and 4 units in y direction. You are now at the vector position (3, 4).</p>

<h2 id="why-do-vectors-matter">Why do vectors matter?</h2>

<p>We use x and y to measure many properties of an object, such as its position, velocity, and acceleration. Using vectors and performing vector mathematics on these properties can be very helpful.</p>

<h1 id="vector-math">Vector Math</h1>

<h2 id="add-two-vectors">Add two vectors</h2>

<p>What does it mean to add two vectors?
We can visualize this such that we have two vectors with different magnitudes and directions.</p>

<p>Vector A has an (x, y) value of (3,4).<br />
Vector B has an (x, y) value of (2,-2).</p>

<p>By adding one to the other we shift the starting point of one the the ending point of the other, we can the trace the vector to this new point.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_add.PNG" alt="Vector addition" /></p>

<p>The mathematics of this is very simple too. Using the vectors above, we can use the calculation:</p>

<p>c.x = a.x + b.x<br />
c.y = a.y + b.y</p>

<p>Using the above vectors as examples. We can determine Vector C by performing:</p>

<p>c.x = 3 + 2 = 5<br />
c.y = 4 + (-2) = 2</p>

<p>Which gives Vector C the value (5,2).</p>

<p>Naturally it doesn’t matter the order in which we add these vectors. This can be represented visually too:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_add_2.PNG" alt="Vector addition doesn't have an order" /></p>

<h2 id="subtract-two-vectors">Subtract two vectors</h2>

<p>Subtracting vectors is very much similar to addition. We can use the equation:</p>

<p>c.x = a.x - b.x<br />
c.y = a.y - b.y</p>

<p>We can represent this visually like so:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_sub.PNG" alt="Vector subtraction" /></p>

<p>In this scenario, we’re subtracting b from a, which we can visualize as the b, pointing in the opposite direction being added to a.</p>

<p>Using our initial A and B vectors, we can calculate C when we subtract B from A.</p>

<p>c.x = 3 - 3 = 0<br />
c.y = 4 - (-2) = 6</p>

<p>Which gives Vector C the value (0, 6).</p>

<p>Just like scalar (single number) subtraction, subtracting b from a gives a different result than subtracting a from b.</p>

<p>c.x = 3 - 3 = 0<br />
c.y = -2 - 4 = -6</p>

<p>Which gives Vector C the value (0, -6).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_sub_2.PNG" alt="Vector subtraction does have an order" /></p>

<p>why is this useful?</p>

<h2 id="vector-multiplication">Vector multiplication</h2>

<p>Another way of thinking about multiplying a vector is scaling a vector, which means we change the vector magnitude but maintain the direction.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_mult.PNG" alt="Vector scaling" /></p>

<p>To scale a vector by a given amount, we multiply it’s x and y properties by a scalar value, e.g. to multiply a vector by 2 we use the following calculation:</p>

<p>c.x = a.x * 2<br />
c.y = a.y * 2</p>

<p>Using Vector A again as our example:</p>

<p>c.x = 3 * 2  = 6
c.y = 4 * 2 = 8</p>

<p>Which gives Vector C the value (6, 8).</p>

<h2 id="vector-magnitude">Vector magnitude</h2>

<p>We’ve talked a lot about the vector magnitude but how do we actually calculate it? You may have noticed a relationship between Vectors and right angle triangles in many of these illustrations. We can think of the magnitude of a vector as the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle, with x and y being the opposite and adjacent sides. 
vector represented as an x and y coordinate. Basic trigonometry teaches us that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the opposite plus the square of the adjacent (c*c = a*a + a*b), therefore we can calculate the magnitude of a vector using the following equation:</p>

<p>mag = sqrt(a*a + b*b)</p>

<p>Using Vector A again as an example, we can calculate its magnitude:</p>

<p>mag = sqrt(3*3 + 4*4)<br />
mag = sqrt(9 + 16)<br />
mag = sqrt(25)<br />
mag = 5</p>

<p>Why would we want to know the magnitude of a vector? This can be useful if we want to set limitations of a vector, e.g. if the magnitude of a vector is greater than 10, we can normalize it, and then multiply it by 10.</p>

<h2 id="vector-normalization">Vector normalization</h2>

<p>Normalizing a vector transforms the magnitude of a vector to 1, while maintaining the angle. In order to normalize a vector, we can divide the x and y values by the magnitude:</p>

<p>c.x = a.x / mag(a)<br />
c.y = a.y / mag(a)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vectors/vector_normalize.PNG" alt="normalizing a vector" /></p>

<p>Once the vector is normalized we can multiply it by any value to set the magnitude.</p>
